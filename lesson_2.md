# Lesson 2 - Notes

## What is Machine Learning?

   Machine Learning can be defined as a technique to extract Patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data and forecast future outcomes, behaviours and trends.

   A machine learning model basically is fed the data and the solutions that we know about as inputs and it produces a set of rules as the output which can be used to forecast future trends.

## Applications of Machine Learning

1. Automating the recognition of a disease
2. Recommendation systems for next best actions for individual health care plans
3. Chatbots for real time interactions


## Brief History of Machine Learning

Artificial Integillence was the idea that first originated to construct complex machines that possess near human senses and intelligence. However, this still remains a farfetched idea.

Machine Learning, a type of artificial intelligence, was the next to emerge which basically was the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.

Artificial Intelligence reached its peak and got a breakthrough with another classification of it being proven - Deep Learning. Deep learning has enabled many practical applications of machine learning and by extension the overall field of AI. Deep learning breaks down tasks in ways that makes all kinds of machine assists seem possible, even likely. Driverless cars, better preventive healthcare, even better movie recommendations, are all here today or on the horizon

## Data Science Process

## Common Types of Data

 1. Numeric : Typically integers and floating point numbers
 2. Time Series: ordering of the numerical data points across points in time
 3. Categorical: Categories of data like gender, location id etc
 4. Text : Large blobs of text like reviews

Eventually all types of data are converted to the numerical type while preparing the data.

## Tabular Data

  Tabular data is the most commonly used data in Machine Learning. The data is arranged in rows and columns where:

  **A row** is an item or an entity
  **A column** is a property for each item or entity
  **A cell** is a single value

### Vectors
  
   Vectors are an array or a list of data. It can be multi dimensional. In machine learning, since all data should be numeric, non numeric data are represented as vectors of numeric data.
